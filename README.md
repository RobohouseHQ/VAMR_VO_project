## Introduction
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a Monocular (single camera) Visual Odometry pipeline developed as part of the  (Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics)[http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/teaching.html] class at ETH ZÃ¼rich. 

<a name="runpipeline"></a>
## Running the pipeline
### Requirements
The code has been developed and tested using MATLAB version 2020b and 2021b. In addition, the following toolboxes are needed:
* image_toolbox
* optimization_toolbox
* statistics_toolbox
* video_and_image_blockset

The screencasts that showcase some sample results [below](#results) have been recorded on a laptop with the following specs:
* Ubuntu 20.04
* Cores: 12
* CPU frequency: 2.6 GHz
* RAM: 16 GB

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository somewhere on your machine.
2. Download at least one of the datasets (KITTI, Malaga, Parking) from [here](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/teaching.html) and place it inside a folder data which you should create at the root of this repository.
3. Open MATLAB and open `main.m`, make sure that the parameters at the top are correct:
```
ds = 0; % 0: KITTI, 1: Malaga, 2: parking
parking_path = 'data/parking';
kitti_path = 'data/kitti';
malaga_path = 'data/malaga-urban-dataset-extract-07';
```
4. Once you are ready, run `main.m`
